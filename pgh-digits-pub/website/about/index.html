  <h2>About this Website</h2>
  <p>We see Digits as scholarly publication reimagined for the digital age, an answer to the question of how we might share and preserve scholarship freed from the affordances of print. Think of it as a journal that works more like a server, a hosting solution to all those projects that don’t fit neatly inside a PDF.</p>
<p>Submit your research on police brutality that updates as more reports filter into data.gov; your interactive map of the Roman world; your interactive report on the dangers and realities of speeding cars in your city; your TEI-encoded collection of Victorian poetry—all without worrying about who pays for the hosting, how it reaches readers, and whether it will persist in the long term. These are the worries publishers already offload, and this is what we will offer without constraining scholarly output to print-based forms.</p>
<p>The idea is a bit like arXiv or PLoS, in that we’ll host, preserve, and give a DOI to anything that’s scholarly. Post-publication peer review, overlay journals, or sophisticated content-specific annotations exist on top, using pre-existing open solutions. However, unlike arXiv or PLoS, we accept multimodal works by leveraging the technological advances in containerization and virtualization. It is also unlike WordPress, Scalar, or Omeka, in that it isn’t a platform that eases the creation of content, but rather a container for forms as simple or complex as the scholars can build.</p>
<p>We’re starting small. A local infrastructure for weird scholarship presented in the Pittsburgh area, a spiritual successor to Stanford LitLab Pamphlets. This pilot, Pittsburgh Digits, will help refine the above goals, demonstrate their plausibility, and invite more diverse voices to help create a flexible means of scholarly distribution that is sensitive to varied needs.</p>
<p>In this spirit, we seek collaborators within and outside Pittsburgh who represent a range of perspectives. We will establish a core planning team to shape Digits from the ground up, an advisory board to provide infrequent but substantive conceptual guidance, a technical team to engage with the inner workings of the digital infrastructure, and content contributors to submit digital scholarship that wouldn’t easily fit into an already established journal/form/medium. If you want to be in one of these four groups, we want that too.</p>
